# VBA Script

This script I wrote loops through data in the stock_data.xls file and outputs the Each Unique Ticker Code its finds along with the Yearly Change, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume for each specific Ticker Code.

It also outputs a table showing which Ticker had the Greatest Increase, Greatest Decrease and Greatest Volume.

There is 3 Years worth of data each year on a separate sheet. The script loops through each sheet and outputs the information for each year.
